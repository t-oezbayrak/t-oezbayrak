**Mechanical Engineer (Energy Background) | MSc Materials Engineering | Structural & Computational Simulation**

I am a mechanically grounded engineer with a background in Energy Systems and advanced specialization in Materials Engineering (Structural Integrity).  
My work focuses on simulation-driven design and multiscale material behavior — from structural FEA and aerodynamic optimization to atomistic modeling using molecular dynamics.

I aim to bridge mechanical performance, material physics, and energy systems through rigorous computational engineering.
