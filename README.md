**Mechanical Engineer (Energy Background) | MSc Materials Engineering | Structural & Computational Simulation**

I am a mechanically grounded engineer with a background in Energy Systems and advanced specialization in Materials Engineering (Structural Integrity).  
My work focuses on simulation-driven design and multiscale material behavior — from structural FEA and aerodynamic optimization to atomistic modeling using molecular dynamics.

I aim to bridge mechanical performance, material physics, and energy systems through rigorous computational engineering.

## Engineering Approach

I approach engineering problems across scales:

- **Atomistic scale:** defect energetics and adsorption behavior  
- **Component scale:** stress distribution and structural reliability  
- **System scale:** packaging, integration, and performance validation  

The unifying principle across all projects is simulation-driven engineering decisions grounded in physical reasoning.
